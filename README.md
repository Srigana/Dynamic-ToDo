# Dynamic-ToDo
The dynamic to-do list website is a user-friendly and interactive application that allows users to create and manage their tasks in a flexible and efficient manner. Users can add tasks using an input field and a "Add Task" button. Each task is displayed with a checkbox and a label. When a task is completed, the label is struck through using CSS to visually indicate its completion. Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete by toggling the checkboxes. The website provides a clean and attractive user interface, making it easy for users to organize and keep track of their tasks effectively.
